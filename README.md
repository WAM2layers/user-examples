# user-examples
This repository contains codes and examples (download/settings/visualization/etc) from researchers working with [WAM2layers/WAM2layers](https://github.com/WAM2layers/WAM2layers)

There are no quality checks done by the WAM2layers core development team, but the idea is to create a low bar for anyone that wishes to share their work with the WAM2layers community.
